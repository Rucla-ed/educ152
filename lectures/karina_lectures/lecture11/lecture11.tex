\begin{frame}{OLS Assumptions}
\protect\hypertarget{ols-assumptions-1}{}

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  The conditional assumption of \(u_i\) given \(X_i\) has a mean a zero
\item
  (\(X_i\), \(Y_i\)), \(i=1, ...n\) are independently and identically
  distributed (i.i.d)
\item
  Large outliers are unlikely
\item
  Homoskedasticity
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If these assumptions hold:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Then our OLS estimators, \(\hat{\beta_0}\) and \(\hat{\beta_1}\)
    have normal distributions in large samples
  \item
    And because they have normal distributions, we can use
    \(\hat{\beta_0}\) and \(\hat{\beta_1}\) to test hypothesess about
    the population parameters \(\beta_0\) and \(\beta_1\)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If these assumptions are violated:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We produced inefficeint and biased estimates, \(\hat{\beta_0}\) and
    \(\hat{\beta_1}\), of the population parameters \(\beta_0\) and
    \(\beta_1\)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{First OLS Assumption}
\protect\hypertarget{first-ols-assumption}{}

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{The conditional assumption of \(u_i\) given \(X_i\) has a mean
  a zero}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What does this mean?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The independent variable \(X_i\) is unrelated to all variables that
    were not included in the model (i.e., \(u_i\))
  \item
    If we violate this assumption, we produce a biased estimate!
  \item
    What's a biased estimate? Consistenly overestimating or
    underestimating population parameter! {[}remember Lec 9?{]}
  \item
    If \(u_i\) given \(X_i\) has a mean a zero = our predictions do not
    systematically over or underestimate, thus balance out to zero = no
    bias!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Thus far we have learned ``simple regression'' (i.e., one independent
  variable of interest) with a major flaw:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We ignore other ``determinants'' (i.e., control variables) of the
    dependent variable that correlate with our one independent variable
    of interest
  \item
    Remember that other ``determinants'' or ``other variables that
    impact the dependent'' variable that are not in our model are
    collected in the residual term \(u_i\), which we have thus far
    \emph{assumed} to be unrelated with the independent variable of
    interest
  \item
    If we exclude these other determinants that are related to our
    independent variable of interest; we introduce estimation bias via
    an omitted variable!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Omitted Variable Bias}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Why does omitted variable bias violate OLS Assumption 1?
  \item
    What happens when you omit a ``Z'' variable from your model? It is
    absorbed by the residual term!
  \item
    We know that the ``Z'' variable omitted from the model is correlated
    to our independent variable of interest, which now means that our X
    is not uncorrelated to the residual = violation of OLS 1!
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{First OLS Assumption cont}
\protect\hypertarget{first-ols-assumption-cont}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Practical Example: What is the effect number of years of schooling on
  income?
\item
  \(Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_i +u_1\)
\item
  There are lots of other factors that would influence income besides
  years of schooling!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If we don't include them in the regression as control variables,
    they are thus relegated to the \(u_1\) and we assume they are not
    systematically related to years of schooling.
  \item
    If this excluded variable meets both conditions of omitted variable
    bias (Z affects Y and Z is related to X); then there is a systematic
    relationship and should not be in the residual!
  \item
    \textbf{By keeping it in the residual (i.e., excluding it from the
    model), we violate OLS Assumption 1 and produce a biased estimate!}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip

In practice, OLS Assumption 1 is the most difficult to prove and the
most important for program evaluation research!

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We can draw on the conditional independence assumption:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Once we include relevant control variables; there are no omitted
    variables that affect Y and have a systematic relationship with X
  \item
    Meaning, if we satisfy the conditional independent assumption
    through control variables, then multiple regression is just as good
    as random assignment experiment (the gold standard of program
    evaluation!)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

  identically distributed (i.i.d)}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What does this mean?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is about sampling!
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\emph{(\(X_i\), \(Y_i\)), \(i=1, ...n\) are independently distributed}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Knowing that observation i takes on particular values for X and Y
  tells you nothing about the probability of the next observation taking
  on particular values for X and Y
\item
  When is assumption of independently distributed violated?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Longitudinal data: knowing a data point in one time period tells you
    something about a data point in another time period

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Ex: Amount of \$ student received via a Federal Pell Grant
      freshman year at UA probably tells you something about how much \$
      student received via a Federal Pell Grant sophmore year at UA
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Hierarchical data:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Ex: Students are nested within classrooms. Knowing the reading
      test score of one student in a classroom is probably correlated
      with reading test score for another student in the same classroom.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Second OLS Assumption cont.}
\protect\hypertarget{second-ols-assumption-cont.}{}

\emph{(\(X_i\), \(Y_i\)), \(i=1, ...n\) are identically distributed}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Prior to choosing sample of observations for the population, the
  probability distribution (i.e., the likelihood that \(Y_i\) takes on
  certain values) is the same for all observation
\item
  This is always true if you take a random sample!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    One randomly selected observation has the same probability of taking
    on a certain value of \(Y_i\) as another randomly selected
    observation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  When is the assumption of identically distributed violated?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Sampling bias:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Ex: You want to investigate probability of being tardy to college
      lectures and take a sample of students living on campus. Sampling
      bias: you did not include commuter students. If you were to
      randomly select a student living on campus, they are not likely to
      have the same probability of being tardy to lecture than a
      randomly selected commuter student.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Third OLS Assumption}

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  Large outliers are unlikely
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Outliers: observations with values of \(X_i\) and \(Y_i\) that are
  outside the ``usual'' range of the data
\item
  Outliers will affect your regression coefficients!
\item
  Stock and Watson have a very technical, mathematical definition of
  when this likely; but in practice this is about really
  investigating/knowing your data
\item
  In practice, if you do find outliers:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Be sure the data is entered correctly and cleaned

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Ex: Survey data codes missing data as very unusual values (-99,
      -99, 99, 98)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Sometimes outliers can belong in the data!
  \item
    If they belong; use natural log of the variable

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Ex: All money variables are usually converted to their natural log
      in econometrics or education research (e.g., state appropriations,
      tuition revenue, household income)
    \end{itemize}

  The distribution of the residuals has constant variance

\item
  Homoskedasticity

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The distribution (the variance!) of the residuals,
    \(u_i = Y_i - \hat{Y_i}\), is constant for all observations. That
    is, it does not change for different values of X
  \item
    Homo-skedasticity = ``equal'' or ``same'' variances
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Heteroskedasticity

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The distribution (the variance!) of the residuals,
    \(u_i = Y_i - \hat{Y_i}\), is not constant for all observations.
    That is, it does change/differs for different values of X
  \item
    Homo-skedasticity = ``unequal'' or ``different'' variances

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fourth OLS Assumption cont.}
\protect\hypertarget{fourth-ols-assumption-cont.-3}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Why is homoskedasticity/heteroskedasticity important?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Because our formula for calculating SE(\(\hat{\beta_1}\)) changes
    based on homoskedastic or heteroskedastic residuals!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In other statistics classes (non program evaluation/econometrics),
  homoskedasticity is the fourth core assumption

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Stock and Watson only discuss the first three assumptions we have
    discussed as core ``OLS Assumptions''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Stock and Watson

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It is NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE to assume homoskedasticity; we almost always
    violate this assumption!
  \item
    But the solution to overcome this assumption is easy!

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      We calculate heteroskedastic standard errors; or in other words,
      standard errors that are \textbf{robust} to violations of
      homoskedasticity
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{SOLUTION}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Rather than make homoskedasticity a core OLS Assumption and always
    violate it;
  \item
    ALWAYS CALCULATE ROBUST STANDARD ERRORS AND DO NOT MAKE
    HOMOSKEDASTICITY A CORE OLS ASSUMPTION

  \textbf{Model}: Logistic Regression

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    Non-linear model because the dependent variables are not continuous

    We will learn a ``related'' model in the next few weeks where we can
    run a linear regression on a 0/1 dummy variable: ``linear
    probability model''

    Example of another ``standard way'' to format regression results
  \item
    Common approach when you are showing lots of models!
  \item
    Common approach when you only care about \(\hat{\beta_1}\); you
    don't show coefficients for controls

  How ``to read'' Table 3

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Each ``cell'' is one regression model's \(\hat{\beta_1}\)
    coefficient
  \item
    ``Variables'' on the rows are the dependent variable for each
    regression model: Graduation \& AIMS tests
  \item
    Columns are the sample each regression model was run on: all
    cohorts, 2008-09, 2009-10, etc.
  \item
    The coefficients are ``marginal effects'' not ``log odd ratios''

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Don't need to know this; you will learn this in HED 613 if you
      take it!
    \item
      ``Marginal effects'' allow us to interpret similar to a linear
      regression!
    \item
      Coefficient interpretation: Being in the non-reference group
      {[}MAS participant{]} as opposed to the reference group {[}Non-MAS
      Participant{]} is associated with a \(\hat{\beta_1}\)*100
      percentage point change in the probability of going from 0 to 1 on
      the dependent variable (for example, 0=don't graduate high school,
      1= graduate high school)

  This is one of my favorite pieces of scholarship! Why?
\item
  This could easily be a student paper that is started in one of these
  statistics class!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Simple question: What is the effect of MAS participation on high
    school graduation?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  It's a topic that was so politically charged that policymakers were
  missing the ``achievement'' trees for the ``political'' forest!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    But the approach was simple. Does the program help students
    academically?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Quantitative work is critiqued for ``not being critical''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Yes, much is problematic!

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Quantitative approaches to education research can reinforce
      privileged systems of knowing/learning/teaching
    \item
      Can use majoritarian assumptions to make blanket statements about
      students, uses race without acknowledging racism, attempts to
      ``control'' these characteristics/experiences
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  But quantitative work can also contribute to a more just system of
  education!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Cabrera, Milem, Jaquette, and Marx (2014) is a great example of
    this!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Also great example of public scholarship!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This is local scholarship! With real implications for our
    surrounding communities!
  \item
    This research played a critical role in a federal judge deciding
    that the state of Arizona acted with discriminatory intent in
    banning the TUSD MAS Program
  \item
    Banning the program violated student's First and Fourteenth
    Amendment rights..
