\begin{frame}{Linear vs Non-Linear Models}
\protect\hypertarget{linear-vs-non-linear-models}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Non-linear relationships can be confusing and difficult to understand!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    So far we have learned \textbf{linear} multiple regression model via
    OLS estimation

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \(Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{1i} + \beta_2X_{2i} + ... \beta_kX_{ki}\)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    But OLS linear regression equation/model doesn't only produce
    straight lines; it can fit curves to your data!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Two ways to think of ``non-linearity'':

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Regression model that is a nonlinear function of the independent
    variables \(X_{1i}, X_{2i}... X_{ki}\)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      This can be estimated by OLS regression model!
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Regression model that is a nonlinear function of the coefficients
    \(\beta_1, \beta_2... \beta_k\)

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      This can't be estimated by OLS!
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The way I think about this

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Is Y continous? If so, then use linear regression model estimated
    via OLS and model curvitures in the data using nonlinear functions
    of the independent variables
  \item
    Is Y is categorical? Is so, then you need a different estimation
    method (e.g., logistic regression via Maximum Likelihood estimation)
    that will model nonlinear functions in the coefficients!

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Exception if Y is a dummy variable (i.e., binary) then you can run
      a linear probability model
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\(X_{1i}, X_{2i}... X_{ki}\)}
\protect\hypertarget{nonlinear-functions-of-the-ivs-x_1i-x_2i...-x_ki}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  OLS linear regression can model nonlinear function of the independent
  variables \(X_{1i}, X_{2i}... X_{ki}\) in two different ways!
\item
  \textbf{1. The effect of \(X_{1i}\) on Y depends on \(X_{1i}\)}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ex: The effect of class size (x) on student test scores (Y) is
    bigger when initial class size is small
  \item
    In other words, the negative effect of increasing class size on test
    scores is much larger when class size increases from 15 to 16 than
    when class size increases from 25 to 26
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{2. The effect of \(X_{1i}\) on Y depends on \(X_{2i}\)}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ex: The effect of class size (x) on student test scores (Y) depend
    on the number of ELL students in the class
  \item
    Ex: The effect of class size (x) on student test scores (Y) depends
    on the teachers' years of experience
  \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let's investigate the effect of district average income (in per
  capita) on student test scores\ldots{}
\item
  Do we think there's a positive or negative linear relationship?
\item
  Does the linear model fit the data well?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Lets plot it and check!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Doesn't look like a linear model fits the data!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In other words, the linear model \emph{overestimates} the
    relationship between Avg Income and Test Scores when income is
    really high or very low; and it \emph{underestimates} the
    relationship for the middle income districts
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Problem: the effect of \(X_{1i}\) on Y depends on \(X_{1i}\)}

RQ: What is the effect of district income on average student test
scores?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Problem}: the effect of \(X_{1i}\) on Y depends on \(X_{1i}\)
\item
  \textbf{Solution}: use a polynomial in X
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\textbf{Polynomials}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Polynomials are independent variables that you raise to a power (e.g.,
  squared or cubed terms)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In practice: to determine the correct polynomial term to include,
    count the number of ``curves'' or ``bends'' in your data!
  \item
    ``Quadratic'' or \(X^2\) = one bend or one curve
  \item
    ``Cubic'' or \(X^3\) = two bends or two curves
  \end{itemize}
\item
  We usually only model a qudratic! Cubics are rare! I have never used
  or seen a quartic term +

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Why? Because polynomials are difficult to interpret the higher term
    you use
  \item
    If you have so many ``bends'' then in practice, convert your
    continous X into a categorical X!
  \end{itemize}

RQ: What is the effect of district income on average student test
scores?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Problem}: the effect of \(X_{1i}\) on Y depends on \(X_{1i}\)
\item
  \textbf{Solution}: use a quadratic in X
\end{itemize}

Population regression model

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Without quadratic:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{1i} +u_i\)
  \item
    Where \(Y_i\) = district average test scores; \(X_1\)= district
    income
  \end{itemize}
\item
  With quadratic:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{1i} + \beta_2{X_1i}^2 + u_i\)
  \item
    Where \(Y_i\) = district average test scores; \(X_1\)= district
    income, \({X_1}^2\) = district income squared
  \item
    \({X_1}^2\) or \(income^2\) is treated as an additional explanatory
    variable!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Run regressions in R

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To run a \emph{quadratic regression model in R}, we still use
    \texttt{lm()} but use two addtional functions \texttt{I()} +
    \texttt{\^{}} to add the quadratic term
  \item
    Why \texttt{I()}?

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Because R is an object-oriented programming language and operators
      \texttt{+,\ -,\ *,\ \^{}} have non-arithmetic functions too.
    \item
      Using \texttt{I()} tells R that we are using them arithmetically
      and that the operator should be passed ``arithmetically'' to the
      \texttt{formula} class object creaated via \texttt{lm()}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\item
  RQ: What is the effect of district income on average student test
  scores?
\item
  \(Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_{1i} + \beta_2{X_1i}^2 + u_i\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Where \(Y_i\) = district average test scores; \(X_1\)= district
    income, \({X_1}^2\) = district income squared
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(\hat{Y_i} = \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}X_{1i} + \hat{\beta_2}{X_1i}^2\)
\item
  \(\hat{Y_i} = 607.30 + 3.85X_{1i} - 0.04{X_1i}^2\)
\item
  Test whether the relationship between test scores and district income
  is linear against the alternative that it is quadratic

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(H_0\): \(\beta_2 = 0\) (e.g., relationship is linear)
  \item
    \(H_a\): \(\beta_2 \ne 0\) (e.g., relationship is quadratic)
  \item
    You could use the t-score and draw the sampling distribution just as
    we have been doing regarding \(\beta_1\)
  \item
    But R will give you the associated p-value for a two-sided
    hypothesis
  \item
    If our p-value is below the alpha level (\(\alpha= .05\)); we reject
    the null!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \(\beta_2\) p-value = 0.00000; reject the null in favor of the
  alternative. In other words, there is a significant, quadratic
  relationship between test scores and district income!

  \textbf{RQ}: What is the relationship(s) between school and district
  characteristics on school's Academic Performance Index?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Old legal approach to school financing: focused on levels and
    patterns of spending

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Didn't work because the state has minimal oversight of local
      educational control/``property taxes''; caps were eliminated via
      voter overrides; and what the small proportion of state funding
      was given ``equally''
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    New legal approach to school financing: \emph{Williams v. State of
    California} reframed the issue of school financing around the
    \emph{conditions} of education rather than funding!

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist

      Worked because the state is responsible for ensuring resources are

    characteristics on API score; rather she's trying to show that API
    score can be predicted by William's case variables!

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist

  Example of how to deal with ``metrics'' that I fundamentally disagree
  with but are part of our educational reality

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Metrics like SAT/ACT scores, standardized K-12 test, are ``firmly
    entrenched part of the political landscape'' that schools and
    students must navigate
  \item
    In many cases, they are institutionalized within federal, state, and
    university/school policies
  \item
    ``Aim is to make a strong argument for equity by marshaling the very
    data that dominate the political discourse'' (p.~765)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Direct response to policies
\item
  Cool understanding of legal logic when it comes to education finance!
