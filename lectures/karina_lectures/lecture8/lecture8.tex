\(\hat{\beta_1}\) and
SER}{Difference between Standard Error of \textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash beta\_1\} and SER}}\label{difference-between-standard-error-of-hatbeta_1-and-ser}}

\begin{frame}{Standard Error of \(\hat{\beta_1}\)}
\protect\hypertarget{standard-error-of-hatbeta_1}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Standard error of \(\hat{\beta_1}\) is the \emph{estimated standard
  deviation} of the \emph{error} in measuring it
\item
  We generate Standard error of \(\hat{\beta_1}\) via hypothesis
  testing!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Hypothesis testing is our attempt to identify variation in a point
    estimate that could be due to sampling (variation that occurs by
    chance from one sample to another) in order to confirm that our
    estimate is ``true'' and did not occur just by random chance! (i.e.,
    statistically significant!)
  \item
    Think of the ``three pictures'':
  \item
    Hypothesis testing about population mean: \(SE(\bar{Y})\) is the
    average distance of a single sample mean \(\bar{Y}\) from the mean
    of sample means \(\bar{Y}_Y\) (mean of sample means = true
    population mean)
  \item
    Hypothesis testing about \(\hat{\beta_1}\): \(SE(\hat{\beta_1})\) is
    the average distance of our sample estimate of the effect of X on Y
    (\(\hat{\beta_1}\)) from the mean of sample estimates of \(\beta_1\)
    (mean of sample estimates = true population \(\beta_1\))
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Our null hypothesis is always \(H_0: \beta_1 = 0\)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Meaning: the effect of X on Y is really zero once we we take into
    account sampling variability. In other words, any non-zero effect we
    find is because of sampling variability!
  \item
    In causal inference research the null hypothesis is a ``straw man'';
    we want to disprove it.
  \item
    Disproving it would mean that our non-zero effect of X on Y is not
    due to random sampling variability, but is indicative of a real,
    causal relationship!
  \item
    The p-value is the probability that the test statistic for
    \(\hat{\beta_1}\) equals the observed value or a value even more
    extreme than \(\hat{\beta_1}\) if \(H_0\) is true
  \item
    A small p-value disproves the null because it would be so unlikely
    (less than 5\% probability) to find the observed data if \(H_0\)
    were true
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

RQ: What is the effect of hours worked per week (X) on annual income
(Y)?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If we run
  \texttt{mod1\ \textless{}-\ lm(realrinc\ \textasciitilde{}\ hrs1,\ data=gss)};
  we get a \(\hat{\beta_1}\)=\$455
\item
  Every one hour increase in hours worked per week is associated with a
  \$455 increase in annual income

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Our slope of relationship between hours worked per week (X) and
    annual income (Y) is \$455
  \item
    How do we determine ``how far'' this slope of \$455 estimated from
    one random sample of 2,348 people is from the true population
    estimate for all people in the US?
  \item
    The standard error of \(\hat{\beta_1}\) is the standard deviation of
    the sampling distribution!
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

SE(\(\hat{\beta_1}\))

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Needed to construct Confidence Intervals
\item
  Needed to rule out how much of our estimate is likely attributed to
  random sampling variability and how likely it is that we're generating
  a statistically significant estimate of the true population effect of
  X on Y.
\item
  So, it is really key to allow you to interpret and evaluate your
  regression model.

    It's completely determined by your sample data
  \item
    Says nothing about how ``far'' our slope estimates based on our one
    random sample likely are from true population parameters!
  \item
    That's why it's a \textbf{measure of model fit or ``goodness of fit
    measure''}! It tells us how good our line is fitting our ONE random
    sample!
  \item
    High SER tells us that our predictions will often be wrong by a lot;
    but in causal inference research that does not necessarily mean our
    model is bad given some things are hard to predict and we often are
    interested in ``averages''!

    likelihood that a relationship between two or more variables is

  \item

    distribution = true population \(\beta_1\)

``Conceptual'' Process for Creating ``analysis'' variables in R

  Investigating values and patterns of variables from ``input data''
\item
  Identifying and cleaning errors or values that need to be changed
\item
  Creating ``analysis'' variables
\item
  Checking values of analysis variables against values of input
  variables
\end{enumerate}

\medskip

How to investigate values and patterns of variable from ``input data''
when X=Categorical

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  use \texttt{var\_label()} + \texttt{val\_labels()} to check variable
  and value labels (not all variables have labels!)
\item
  use \texttt{count()} to get a frequency count of each category
\item
  use \texttt{count()} + \texttt{is.na()} to explicitly check if there
  are any missing observations
\end{itemize}

  What if we want to create a dummy variable?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    high\_ses = 1 for respondents in top two quartiles {[}non-reference
    group{]}
  \item
    high\_ses = 0 for respondents in bottom two quartiles {[}reference
    group{]}
  \item
    And true missing observations should be \texttt{NA}
  \item
    always code your reference group as the lowest value!
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip

Create dummy vars via \texttt{mutate()} + \texttt{ifelse()} {[}My
general process{]}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Create two \textbf{new variables}
\item
  First new variable will be a ``version 2'' of the input variable that
  codes ``true missing'' (\texttt{NA}) for values -8 in the original
  variable (\texttt{f1ses1qu\_v2})
\item
  Then, I create my analysis variable that is coded via dummy values
  according to reference and non-reference categories above
  (\texttt{ses\_high})
\end{itemize}

  What if we want to create a multi-categorical variable that is very

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist

    quartile=1
  \item
    Respondents in top quartiles (2,3,4) {[}non-reference groups{]}
  \item
    Respondents in lowest quartile (1) {[}reference group{]}
  \item
    And true missing observations should be \texttt{NA}
  \item
    always code your reference group as the lowest value!

When creating a new variable that is ``simple'' (only one input
variable), create it via \texttt{mutate()} + \texttt{recode()}

\item

\textbf{Some cautionary ``don'ts''}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Don't freak out! Goal is to get some experience/practice! :)
\item
  Don't pick a dataset or research question that is going to require
  substantial effort/time in building an analysis dataset!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Unless you will be using these data for something other than this
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Do not pick a research question where you attempt to asses an
  intervention using outcome before the intervention in comparison to
  outcome after the intervention (i.e., pre and post tests)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This requires additional longitudinal modeling methods that we will
    not cover in this course!
  \item
    Start with analyzing the effect of an intervention on an outcome
    that occurs \emph{after} the intervention
  \item
    Need to pick a research question where you have variation in your
    independent variable of interest (e.g., TRIO participants and
    non-TRIO participants) and outcome data across that variation (i.e.,
    GPAs for both participants/non-participants)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\textbf{Do:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Think of this as a pilot study using ``preliminary data''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I don't care if you get significant results or not
  \item
    I care more that you are learning how to craft the different
    sections of the paper given your research question and getting some
    practice with data management/interpreting results
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Control Variables {[}haven't covered yet!{]}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Your paper must discuss what variables should be included to avoid
    omitted variable bias (we'll cover this in the next few weeks); but
    your model does not have to actually have ALL OF THEM

\item
  Fundamental requirements:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Must be feasible for your independent variable to be randomly
    assigned in a random experiment
  \item
    Your dependent variable (Y) needs to be continuous or 0/1
  \item
    Your dependent variable (Y) must be measured at a time after your
    independent variable (X) occurs
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Easiest independent variables that meet this requirement:
  participation in a program/intervention

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Federal programs: TRIO, Head Start
  \item
    Interventions: dropout prevention program, college prep, financial
    literary programs, using ``services'' like Think Tank, Cultural
    Centers, etc.
  \item
    Others: Student Teacher Ratio, type of sanction (diversion vs
    community service)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip

Avoid:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Independent variables that can't be randomly assigned or are hard to
  measure

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Attitudes or ideologies
  \item
    Culture
  \item
    Leadership Style
  \item
    Personal demographics
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exception to using personal demographics as X}
\protect\hypertarget{exception-to-using-personal-demographics-as-x}{}

Generally OK to use personal demographics as X when Y variable is
determined by someone else

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Effect of racial identity (X) on the probability of receiving a reply
  to an admissions inquiry (Y)?
\item
  Effect of racial identity (X) on probability of receiving a call back
  job interview (Y)?
\item
  Effect of gender (X) on teacher course evaluations (Y)?
\end{itemize}

\item
  Importance in regards to informing policy and practice:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    What is the effect of offering max pell grant on college completion?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  ``Interesting'' research

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Sometimes ``good'' research questions are of interest to particular
    audiences (researchers, practitioners, etc)
  \item
    EX: Do public universities recruit students in low-income,
    Communities of Color
  \item
    This example doesn't inform policy explicitly; but shows insights
    into the enrollment priorities of admissions offices
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item
  You can start with your X
\item
  You can start with your Y
