	Today: Conceptual introduction to matching
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Gain deeper understanding of Rubin's Causal Model/ potential outcomes framework, which is core to matching

	Following two weeks: Deeper understanding of matching
		\begin{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item sample=high school grad in 2004; salary measured in 2011
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{2mm}
	Each person $i$ has two \textbf{potential outcomes} \(Y_i\)

	How to think about potential outcomes
	\begin{itemize}
		\item for each person $ i$, the treated potential outcome $ Y_i(1) $ and the untreated potential outcome $ Y_i(0) $ already exist
		\item Treatment variable $ T_i $ just determines which of the two potential outcomes we get to observe

Matching [average effect of treatment on treated (ATT)]
\begin{itemize}
	\item Goal: for each treated unit, we have $Y_i(1)|T=1$ but we need to find counterfactual $Y_i(0)|T=1$
	\item Matching identifies untreated units that are similar to each treated unit
	\item Use $Y_i(0)|T=0$ for the untreated unit as a substitute for $Y_i(0)|T=1$ of the treated unit
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Substitute for counterfactual may contain data from several untreated $i$s
	\end{itemize}
	%\item Find match for each treated unit; 
	\item For each treated unit, calculate the difference between actual  $Y_i(1)|T=1$ and substitute for the counterfactual
	\item ATT is just the average of this difference
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm}

Matching to calculate average treatment effect ATE
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calculate ATT (as above)
	\item For each untreated $i$, find similar treated $i$ and follow steps above

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Population regression: $Y_i=\alpha T_i+\beta X_i + \epsilon_i$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are \textbf{population parameters}
			\item $\alpha$ is ATE: average effect (for all) of receiving treatment rather than control
			\item $T_i=$treatment; $X_i=$ ``control'' variables
		\end{itemize}
		\item OLS regression line: $\hat{Y}_i=\hat{\alpha} T_i+\hat{\beta} X_i$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\hat{\alpha}$ is our estimate of ATE
			\item Reynolds and DesJardins (2009) describe regression as ``parametric'' in that we are estimating parameters
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{2mm}
	Assumption to claim $\hat{\alpha}$ is unbiased estimate of $\alpha$ (the ATE):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $E(u_{i}|T_{i}) = 0$ ; Independent variable $X_{i}$ is unrelated to the ``other factors", $u_{i}$, not included in model
		\item i.e., no omitted variables that both (i) affect $Y_i$ \textbf{and} (ii) systematically related to $T_i$
		\item Also assumes we correctly specified the functional form linking $Y_i$ to control variables $X_i$

		\item Statistically control for observable characteristics
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{2mm}
	Matching approach
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Substitute for counterfactual is not a parameter estimate; rather, choose an observation that represents best counterfactual for each treated $i$

			\item $\hat{Y}_i=\hat{\alpha} T_i+\hat{\beta} X_i$
		\end{itemize}
			\item Predicted outcome given treatment:
		\begin{itemize}
		\item $ \hat{Y}_{1i} = \hat{\alpha}(T=1)+ \hat{\beta}(X_i)= \hat{\alpha}+ \hat{\beta}(X_i)$
		\end{itemize}
		\item Estimate counterfactual ($Y_i(0)|T_i=1$) by T=1 with T=0
		\begin{itemize}

	\end{enumerate}
	\vspace{2mm}
	How matching constructs the counterfactual, $Y_i(0)|T_i=1$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Matching methods do not use estimated parameters to construct counterfactual
		\item Missing counterfactual ($Y_i(0)|T_i=1$) constructed from actual outcomes of untreated units that are matched to treated units

	\begin{itemize}

		\item Assumption: when identifying untreated i similar to treated i, you include \textbf{all} variables that drive both the outcome and selection into the treatment
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{2mm}
	For each possible combination of $X$s, must have at least one untreated $i$ to match to treated $i$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Not an issue when sample size is large and small number of variables drive $Y$ and selection into treatment, $T$
		\item For example, imagine ``first-gen'' is only X that affects both $Y$ and $T$

	Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Matching on predicted probability of treatment given X is equivalent to matching on X
		\item Matching on probability of treatment balances distribution of observable characteristics across treated and untreated groups
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Probability that any treated unit has specific trait (e.g., high income) will be same as probability untreated unit has that trait
		\end{itemize}

	\vspace{3mm}
	Solution to the curse of dimensionality
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Propensity score ($\hat{P}_i(X)$): probability unit $i$ treated given their observable characteristics X
		\item Instead of matching on individual characteristics (X), match on probability of treatment given X
		\begin{itemize}
			\item e.g., match treated $i$ with ($\hat{P}_i(X)=.8$) to untreated $i$ with ($\hat{P}_i(X)=.8$)

			\item X=variables that affect outcome of interest and selection into treatment
			\item Usually, this is ``logistic'' or ``probit'' regression, rather than OLS
			\item $\hat{Y}_i$ from this regression is the propensity score (probability of treatment)
		\end{itemize}
		\item Match treated units with untreated units that have similar propensity scores

			\item Assumption 3 (``balance''): after matching, are untreated similar to treated on observed characteristics?

\section[Practical example]{Practical example of implementing matching using ``nearest neighbor'' approach}

\begin{frame}{Choose method (algorithm) to match controls to treated}
Generally, take a treated unit and find one or more control units with a similar propensity
\begin{itemize}
	\item Key: face a tradeoff between bias and efficiency (standard errors)
	\item Limit matches to very good matches (very similar propensities)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item End up with small sample size (high SEs) and little bias
			\end{itemize}
	\item Allow matches to differ
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Larger sample size (low SEs), but probably some bias, because matches are not as good
			\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Pick a treated unit, find control whose propensity score is closest
	\end{itemize}
	\item With or without replacement
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Without replacement: once a treated and control unit are matched, the control is pulled out of the pool
			\item With replacement: single control can be matched to multiple treated units 
			\item Tradeoff between bias and efficiency
		\end{itemize}
	\item Can also oversample (more than one control per treated); recommended if your sample is larger enough
	\item Generally not used by itself
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Nearest neighbor could be very far away (i.e., a bad match)
				\item Use of a caliper solves this problem

	\item Difference in means
	\item Standardized bias - difference between sample means as a percentage of square root of variances
