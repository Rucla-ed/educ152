# Review of Statistics

## Statistical Inference

_Goal of statistical inference is to infer something about the population from a sample_

\medskip
__Population Parameter__: a  measure of the population

- e.g., mean household income for all U.S. households; proportion of all American voters approving president's performance;
- We don't know this 99.9999999% of the time because we don't have data on the entire population

\medskip
__Sample__ is part of, a subset, of the population

\medskip
__Estimator (or Statistic)__: a formula or procedure used to estimate the value of the population parameter using a sample of the population

- e.g., formula to calculate sample mean ($\bar{Y}$) or sample proportion ($\hat{p}$)

\medskip
__Point Estimate__:  numeric value generated from calculating an estimator from a specific sample of data

- e.g., sample mean household income is $81,000, 2017 American Community Survey  



## Parameters and Point Estimates

Introductory statistics class

- Parameter: Population mean ($\mu_Y$)
- Estimator: Sample mean ($\bar{Y}$)
- RQs: What is the mean GPA of UA students living in residence halls?

\medskip

Multivariate regression class

- Parameter: Population regression coefficient ($\beta$)
- Estimator: Sample regression coefficient ($\hat{\beta}$)
- RQs: What is the effect of living in residence halls on GPA?


## Notation for Parameters 

Population Parameters

- Denoted by Greek setters, usually lowercase 
    - $\mu$ : "mu" refers to population mean
    - $\sigma$: "sigma" refers to population standard deviation
    - $\beta$: "beta" refers to population regression coefficient 
    
- Subscripts usually denote population parameters of certain variables
    - $\mu_Y$ : "mu Y" refers to population mean of the variable Y
    - $\sigma_X$: "sigma X" refers to population standard deviation of the variable X
    
\medskip    
Estimators of Population Parameters (two general approaches)

- Denoted using Greek letters with a "hat"
    - $\hat{\mu}_Y$ : "mu Y hat" refers to the estimate of $\mu_Y$ 
    - $\hat{\beta}_X$: "beta X hat" refers to the estimate of $\beta_X$

- Denoted using English/Arabic letters
    - $\bar{Y}$: "Y bar" refers to the estimate of $\mu_Y$
    - $s_X$: "S of X" refers to the estimate of $\sigma_X$

## Data Sources 

__Experimental Data__: obtained from experiments designed to assess the causal effect of a "treatment" on an outcome

- randomized control trials (experiments) are the __gold standard__ of program evaluation [will learn more about this]
- e.g., Tennessee STAR project

\medskip
\medskip

__Observational Data__: obtained from surveys, administrative records [focus of this course]

- researchers have/had no control on the "treatment"
- e.g., Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, High School Longitudinal Study, National Education Longitudinal Study

## Data Types

__Cross sectional data__: data on different "observations" (e.g., students, classrooms, universities) for a single point in time [focus of this course]

- e.g., California Test Score data where "observations" are districts 

\medskip
__Time-Series Data__: data on a single "observation" collected at multiple time points

- e.g., US inflation and unemployment rate data 1959-2000

\medskip
__Longitudinal Data__ (or panel data): data on multiple "observations" at multiple time points 

- e.g., Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, High School Longitudinal Study, National Education Longitudinal Study


## Variables

__Continuous Variables__

- Variables that take on a continuum of possible values where the distance between one value and another is meaningful
- Examples: Age, income, GPA, test scores



\medskip

__Discrete Variables__ (or categorical variables)

- Variables that can only take on specific (discrete) integer values
- Can be nominal (school type), ordinal (likert scale), and quantitative (number of children)


## Measures of Central Tendency: Sample Mean

Sample mean of Y or denoted as $\bar{Y}$

- $\bar{Y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i}{n}$
  - where subscript _i_ refers to the observation i

\medskip

Example: Variable Y has the following six observations ($Y_1... Y_6$)

- Obs: $Y_1 = 5, Y_1 = 2, Y_3 = 13, Y_4 = 11, Y_5 = 18, Y_6 = 22$
- Calculate $\bar{Y}$

\medskip
Other measures of central tendency:

- Median
- Mode


## Measures of Dispersion: Standard Deviation


Sample standard deviation of Y or denoted as $\hat\sigma_Y$

- Standard deviation is, on average, how far away a random observation, $Y_i$, is from the sample mean, $\bar{Y}$

- $\hat\sigma_Y = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (Y_i - \overline{Y})^2}{N-1}}$
  - "square root of sum of squared deviations divided by n-1"

\medskip

Example: Variable Y has the following six observations ($Y_1... Y_6$)

- Obs: $Y_1 = 5, Y_1 = 2, Y_3 = 13, Y_4 = 11, Y_5 = 18, Y_6 = 22$
- Calculate $\hat\sigma_Y$

\medskip
Other measures of dispersion:

- Variance (SD is the square root of the variance)
- Range


## Sample Mean & Standard Deviation

Substantive interpretation(s):

- Which distribution has the greatest mean and lowest mean?
- Which distribution has the greatest standard deviation and lowest standard deviation?

![](distributions.png)

Substantive interpretation(s):

Consider the SAT scores of students at a large, public high school and the SAT scores of the Harvard freshman class: 

- Which do you think has a larger mean?

- Which do you think has a larger standard deviation?

## Sampling Distribution & Central Limit Theorem

Many of the statistical tests we use (e.g., t-tests, confidence intervals) assume that populations we work with are normally distributed.

- A bit unrealistic (outliers, skewness, bimodal)

\medskip
An appropriate sample size and _Central Limit Theorem_ can help us get around this assumption!

- We usually determine appropriate sample size via exploratory data analysis

\medskip
__Central Limit Theorem__: No matter the distribution of our population parameter, given a suffficiently large sample size, the sampling distribution of the estimate (e.g., mean) for a variable will approximate a normal distribution. 

Sampling Distribution

- __Mean of Sample Means__ ($\bar{Y}_Y$) = population mean ($\mu_Y$)
- __Standard Error__ $SE(\bar{Y})$: the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. In other words it is the average distance between a random sample mean and the mean of sample means.

<!-- ## Bias and Precision -->
<!-- __Unbiased point estimate__: an estimator for a particular random sample is unbiased if its distribution centers around the population parameter (mean of sample means) -->

<!-- __Precise point estimate__: an estimator is precise if it does not vary considerably from sample to sample (low SE) -->

<!-- \includegraphics[width=200pt]{precision-bias.png} -->


# R Basics

## R Script Basics

Go to the lecture2.R script I had you download before class

\medskip
__Within an R script you can run commands in different ways__:

1. One command at a time by highlighting only that command and clicking the "Run" Button
1. Several commands at a time by highlighting several commands and clicking the "Run" Button
1. Run the entire R script by not highlighting any commands and clicking the "Run" Button

\medskip
__Comments__

- `#` Will comment out the remainder of syntax on that line
- `" "` Will comment out anything between the quotation marks (multiple lines)


## Tidyverse 

- R sytanx for this class will all be given to you. 
- For problem sets, you often will get an example of the code you need to run in the lecture or directly in the instructions; you'll often use that code as template for you the specific task you are working on
- While you have the template; you will often need to change a "couple of minor things" (e.g., the variable name; the "function" for the statistical test you are trying to run, etc.)
- So you will still need to develop some "intuition" as to what the code is doing
- All code (very few exceptions) will be written in the "tidyverse" way as opposed to base R
  - Base R: the "default" coding approach to R; it can be very inefficient
  - Tidyverse: most popular way to write R code that does simple tasks (everything we do in this class is considered simple)
- Most distinctive part of Tidyverse approach to R syntax is using pipes or piping operator `%>%`
  - Allows for "sequential computations" or multiple commands/tasks in the same line of code
  - I usually think of the words "AND THEN" every time I see a pipe
- `caschool %>% select(enrl_tot, computer, read_scr) %>% var_label()`
  - `caschool`= open the california school dataset __AND THEN__
  - `select(enrl_tot, computer, read_scr)` = select the three variables enrol_tot, computer, read_scr __AND THEN__
  - `var_label()` = print the labels for the three variables selected
